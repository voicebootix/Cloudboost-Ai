# CloudBoost AI - Deployment Version

## Current Deployment State
- **Date**: 2025-07-06
- **Status**: Fixed Flask backend, fixing frontend dependencies
- **Backend**: âœ… Python configuration working
- **Frontend**: ðŸ”„ Adding missing Radix UI dependencies

## Recent Fixes Applied

### Backend Fixes âœ…
1. Removed root `package.json` that was causing Node.js detection
2. Removed `Procfile` and `runtime.txt` (not needed with `render.yaml`)
3. Created missing service files:
   - `social_service.py`
   - `crm_service.py`
   - `content_service.py`
   - `automation_service.py`
   - `analytics_service.py`
4. Backend now properly uses Python configuration

### Frontend Fixes ðŸ”„
1. Added all required Radix UI dependencies to `package.json`:
   - `@radix-ui/react-slot`
   - `@radix-ui/react-dialog`
   - `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu`
   - And all other Radix UI components
2. Added additional dependencies:
   - `class-variance-authority`
   - `react-hook-form`
   - `@hookform/resolvers`
   - `zod`

## Current Error
```
[vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "@radix-ui/react-slot" from "/opt/render/project/src/frontend/src/components/ui/badge.jsx"
```

## Solution
The `package.json` has been updated with all required dependencies. The deployment should now work correctly.

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push the updated `package.json`
2. Redeploy on Render
3. Frontend should build successfully with all dependencies

## Verification
- Backend: Should start without Flask import errors
- Frontend: Should build without missing dependency errors
- Both services should be accessible via their respective URLs
