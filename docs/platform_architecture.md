## 1. Microservices Architecture Design {#microservices-architecture}

### 1.1 Service Decomposition Strategy

The CloudBoost AI platform is architected as a collection of loosely coupled microservices, each responsible for specific business capabilities and designed for independent deployment, scaling, and maintenance. This approach enables the platform to handle complex business requirements while maintaining flexibility and reliability.

The service decomposition follows domain-driven design principles, organizing services around business capabilities rather than technical layers. Each service owns its data and business logic, communicating with other services through well-defined APIs and asynchronous messaging patterns.

The core services include the API Gateway Service for request routing and authentication, the User Management Service for authentication and authorization, the Business Intelligence Service for business analysis and setup, the Content Generation Service for AI-powered content creation, the Social Media Service for platform integrations and automation, the Communication Service for multi-channel messaging, the CRM Service for customer relationship management, the Analytics Service for data processing and reporting, the Workflow Service for automation and decision-making, and the Notification Service for real-time updates and alerts.

Each service is designed with clear boundaries and minimal dependencies, enabling independent development teams to work on different services simultaneously while maintaining system coherence. The services communicate through standardized REST APIs for synchronous operations and Apache Kafka for asynchronous event-driven communication.

### 1.2 API Gateway Architecture

The API Gateway serves as the single entry point for all client requests, providing a unified interface that abstracts the complexity of the underlying microservices architecture. The gateway handles cross-cutting concerns including authentication, authorization, rate limiting, request routing, response aggregation, and comprehensive logging.

The gateway implements OAuth 2.0 and JWT-based authentication, validating tokens and extracting user context for downstream services. Rate limiting is implemented at multiple levels including per-user, per-API, and global limits to protect against abuse and ensure fair resource allocation.

Request routing utilizes intelligent load balancing algorithms that consider service health, response times, and current load to optimize request distribution. The gateway maintains circuit breaker patterns to handle service failures gracefully and prevent cascade failures across the system.

Response aggregation capabilities enable the gateway to combine data from multiple services into unified responses, reducing client complexity and network overhead. The gateway also implements request/response transformation to maintain API versioning and backward compatibility.

### 1.3 Service Communication Patterns

Inter-service communication utilizes both synchronous and asynchronous patterns depending on the use case requirements. Synchronous communication through REST APIs is used for real-time operations that require immediate responses, while asynchronous messaging through Apache Kafka is used for event-driven workflows and eventual consistency scenarios.

The event-driven architecture enables loose coupling between services by allowing services to publish events when significant business events occur, with interested services subscribing to relevant events. This pattern supports complex business workflows that span multiple services while maintaining service independence.

Event sourcing is implemented for critical business entities, storing all changes as a sequence of events rather than just the current state. This approach provides complete audit trails, enables temporal queries, and supports complex business analytics and reporting requirements.

The messaging infrastructure implements guaranteed delivery, message ordering, and duplicate detection to ensure reliable event processing. Dead letter queues handle failed message processing, enabling manual intervention and system recovery.

### 1.4 Data Management Strategy

Each microservice owns its data and implements appropriate data storage strategies based on its specific requirements. The platform utilizes polyglot persistence, selecting the most appropriate database technology for each service's data patterns and access requirements.

Transactional services utilize PostgreSQL for ACID compliance and complex relational queries. Document-oriented services use MongoDB for flexible schema and rapid development. Caching layers implement Redis for session management and frequently accessed data. Analytics services utilize ClickHouse for time-series data and complex analytical queries.

Data consistency across services is managed through the Saga pattern for distributed transactions, ensuring eventual consistency while maintaining service independence. Compensating actions handle transaction failures and maintain data integrity across service boundaries.

Data synchronization between services is handled through event-driven updates, with services publishing data change events that interested services can consume to maintain their local views of shared data.
