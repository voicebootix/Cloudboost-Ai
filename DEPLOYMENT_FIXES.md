# CloudBoost AI - Deployment Fixes

## Issue Resolved: Flask Module Not Found

### Problem
The deployment was failing with the error:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'
```

### Root Cause
The deployment was treating the project as a Node.js application due to the presence of a root `package.json` file, instead of using the Python configuration in `render.yaml`.

### Solution Applied

1. **Removed conflicting files:**
   - Deleted root `package.json` (was causing Render to treat as Node.js project)
   - Deleted `Procfile` (not needed with `render.yaml`)
   - Deleted `runtime.txt` (not needed with `render.yaml`)

2. **Created missing service files:**
   - `backend/src/services/social_service.py`
   - `backend/src/services/crm_service.py`
   - `backend/src/services/content_service.py`
   - `backend/src/services/automation_service.py`
   - `backend/src/services/analytics_service.py`

3. **Verified configuration:**
   - `render.yaml` is properly configured for Python deployment
   - `requirements.txt` contains all necessary dependencies
   - All model files are present and properly structured

### Current Deployment Configuration

The `render.yaml` file correctly configures:
- **Backend Service**: Python environment with proper build and start commands
- **Frontend Service**: Node.js environment for the React frontend
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database
- **Redis**: Redis service for caching and sessions

### Build Commands
```yaml
buildCommand: "cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt"
startCommand: "cd backend && gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT src.main:app"
```

### Environment Variables
- `FLASK_ENV=production`
- `DATABASE_URL` (from PostgreSQL database)
- `REDIS_URL` (from Redis service)
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY` (auto-generated)
- API keys for external services (configured manually)

### Testing
Created `backend/test_app.py` to verify:
- All imports work correctly
- Flask app can start without errors
- Health endpoint responds properly

### Next Steps
1. Deploy to Render using the updated configuration
2. Configure environment variables in Render dashboard
3. Test the health endpoint at `/health`
4. Verify all services are working correctly

### Expected Result
The deployment should now succeed and the Flask backend should start properly with all dependencies installed.
