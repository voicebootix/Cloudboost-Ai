# CloudBoost AI - Deployment Debug

## Current Issue
Render is still treating the backend as a Node.js service instead of Python, despite having `render.yaml` configured.

## Problem Analysis
1. **Root Cause**: Render is auto-detecting the project as Node.js due to `frontend/package.json`
2. **Issue**: The `render.yaml` configuration is not being used properly
3. **Result**: Backend tries to run without Python dependencies installed

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Enhanced render.yaml
- Added explicit Python version specification
- Added more descriptive comments
- Ensured proper service naming

### 2. Added Backend-Specific Files
- `backend/runtime.txt` - Specifies Python 3.11.7
- `backend/Procfile` - Specifies gunicorn startup command
- `.render-buildpacks` - Explicitly specifies buildpacks per service

### 3. Alternative Approaches to Try

#### Option A: Manual Service Creation
If `render.yaml` continues to not work, create services manually in Render dashboard:
1. Create backend service as Python
2. Set build command: `cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set start command: `cd backend && gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT src.main:app`

#### Option B: Separate Repositories
If auto-detection continues to fail:
1. Move backend to separate repository
2. Move frontend to separate repository
3. Deploy each independently

#### Option C: Force Python Detection
Create a root `requirements.txt` that points to backend:
```txt
-r backend/requirements.txt
```

## Current Status
- Backend: ❌ Still not installing Python dependencies
- Frontend: ✅ Dependencies added, should work once backend is fixed
- Configuration: ✅ All files properly configured

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push all changes
2. If deployment still fails, try manual service creation
3. Consider separate repositories if auto-detection continues to fail

## Expected Result
After fixes, Render should:
1. Detect backend as Python service
2. Install Flask and all dependencies
3. Start gunicorn server successfully
4. Frontend should build with all Radix UI dependencies
